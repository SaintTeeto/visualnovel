To be or not to be, a question some random English guy asked himself ages ago. Now we stand her, united in one way, programming and we are not sure what to do. Can we do this project or can't we? Are we able to turn everything around and create a master piece? Are we or aren't we?

Two days ago I ate a donut. I was able to eat it.  But can I do this project? What about Teeto? Can he do it? Can we all do it?
I don't know. We shall find the truth.
